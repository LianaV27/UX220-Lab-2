            The best thing that I read recently was the poem, <q>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</q> by T. S. Eliot. I had first studied this poem in secondary school.
            I came across it recently when I recalled the line about measuring a life in coffee spoons and sought its origins. While that line, like many others in the poem, 
            sounds pleasant and romantic when isolated from the rest of the poem, it takes on a different meaning in its original context. The poem describes the inner world 
            of a cowardly man who is indecisive with his desire to interact with others and make an impact on anything. He constantly questions his actions, restlessly
            doubting and dismissing himself. <q>Do I dare disturb the universe?</q> he questions. Ultimately, he always chooses a path of inaction and observation. <br><br>
            The poem left me unsettled due to the passive nature of its subject, stuck in a world teeming with life, constantly shifting around him. I am fascinated with 
            the strange images woven by the fantastical comparisons drawn amidst the at times mundane, yet often morbid descriptions of his life. Now that I am older, I feel that 
            I better understand this poem's complexity. I also feel compelled to seek out other poems that left an impression on me and search for new ones to enjoy.
